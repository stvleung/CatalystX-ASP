=head1 NAME

CatalystX::ASP::Role - Catalyst Role to plug-in the ASP View

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  package MyApp;

  use Moose;
  use Catalyst;
  extends 'Catalyst';

  with 'CatalystX::ASP::Role';

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Compose this role in your main application class. This will inject the ASP View
as View component in your app called 'ASP', accessible via
C<< $c->view('ASP') >>. It will also add a C<DispatchType> which will direct all
requests with C<.asp> extension to the View.
